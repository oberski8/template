			<h1>Eli Broad College of Business</h1>
			<p>Michigan State is ranked 27th in the nation for their business school.  To be apart of the Eli Broad College of Business one must compete a certain amount of credits and experiences.  To apply to the College of Business one must accumulate at least 56 credits and take the business pre-core classes that will then decide your cumulative GPA. The pre-courses are CSE, Econ 201-202, and Accounting 201-202. Grades are indeed very important, seeing that the business college is very competitive; but they are not the only factor. The second factor is non-academic.  The two things that are asked are oneâ€™s experiential profile, and a case study.  This gives a student the chance to express their passion and enthusiasm for business.  This is the time to inform the business college what you have done related to business and how responsible you are in that field. The case study is a problem-solving task. It reflects an issue that may happen in the workforce that needs to be handled or fixed. The student must take what they have learned or experienced and plan out what they would do in that situation. This gives the college of business a chance to see if the student knows how to handle tricky situations. Applying to the business college is competitive but if one is passionate, intelligent, experienced, and responsible, the world of business will await them. </p>
