			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>
With teen pregnancy being falsely portrayed by MTV, the issue at hand more is that more and more teens are tuning in on Monday nights at 8 pm thinking that being a teen mom is normal. The United States has the highest percent of teen pregnancies. Stats show that females ages 15-19 in the year of 2011 had over 15,000 pregnancies in Michigan alone. Overall there were over 30,000 15-19 year olds that are classified as mothers.  Mom logic says, “We are failing our teenagers, flooding their minds with ineffective and inconsistent messages regarding sexuality and reproduction”.  The TV series on MTV is clearly not helping the situation; ratings are skyrocketing, resulting in more and more young girls getting pregnant on their show. Is the point that these girls get pregnant in hopes to get famous? Not necessarily, the point is that teen pregnancy is now a regular part of society, the show only encourages this “normality” by creating celebrities out of the mothers, like another fashion trend seen on TV. If any of the four teen moms were said in a common teenager girl’s conversation, they would know immediately whom one was talking about. Yes these teen moms are now “celebrities” but in a very infamous way.  The attention they are receiving is from their irresponsible actions--an act that should not be applauded with such negative behavior. Young girls need role models to look up to and with shows like this on television, stigmas and the innocence of a young girl’s youth will never return to its once balanced state.
