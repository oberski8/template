			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>
With teen pregnancy being falsely portrayed by MTV, the issue at hand more is that more and more teens are tuning in on Monday nights at 8 pm thinking that being a teen mom is normal. The United States has the highest percent of teen pregnancies. Stats show that females ages 15-19 in the year of 2011 had over 15,000 pregnancies in Michigan alone. Overall there were over 30,000 15-19 year olds that are classified as mothers.  Mom logic says, “We are failing our teenagers, flooding their minds with ineffective and inconsistent messages regarding sexuality and reproduction”.  The TV series on MTV is clearly not helping the situation; ratings are skyrocketing, resulting in more and more young girls getting pregnant on their show. Is the point that these girls get pregnant in hopes to get famous? Not necessarily, the point is that teen pregnancy is now a regular part of society, the show only encourages this “normality” by creating celebrities out of the mothers, like another fashion trend seen on TV. If any of the four teen moms were said in a common teenager girl’s conversation, they would know immediately whom one was talking about. Yes these teen moms are now “celebrities” but in a very infamous way.  The attention they are receiving is from their irresponsible actions--an act that should not be applauded with such negative behavior. Young girls need role models to look up to and with shows like this on television, stigmas and the innocence of a young girl’s youth will never return to its once balanced state. 
</p><p>Another issue that is being presented by this series is stereotypes. Almost all the mothers on the show are from the south, have divorced parents, have relationship problems, or issues with drugs and alcohol. This persona is making people that deal with those issues look badly, or think that getting pregnant at a young age is typical. The personal issues on the show happen so much that it almost appears like normal behavior. These problems should be presented to someone that can help these girls instead of being aired on national television. Lastly the series show the viewers how the teens have to downsize their life plans like finishing school for the new life they have brought into the world.  An education is one of the most important things you can have now a days and most of the girls in the show don’t finish high school and put off their GED for a long time. That is not something young women need to follow after. Teen mom and Sixteen and Pregnant are not shows that should be on television because it is not something that young women should pay attention to. </p>
