			<h1>Experience</h1>
			<p>A very important thing a student can do is gain different experiences in the field. One can study and test-take all they want on a subject but they won’t truly understand until the real life experience is in play. Study abroad programs are a great way to make a student very versatile. It shows that they have out-of-America experience and that they aren’t afraid of trying something out of their comfort zone. Another very important thing for a student is internships. The more experience one has, the more appealing they are to an employer. The more a student has on their resume the better. Professor D. Wilson states that students should, “stand out in some way, you can’t do everything but do stuff to make yourself seem different.” Employers are looking to find people who will make a positive impact on their company.  Someone with a large amount of experience and leadership will come out on top compared to others when it comes to interviews.
