			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Sixteen and Pregnant first aired on MTV June 11, 2009. It is a documentary formatted reality TV show about high school girls and their experience with pregnancy.  Each show would feature a handful of girls around four to eight months pregnant, and film their every day struggles and activities as a young child barer. These girls--keeping in mind that they are still like children--are not the best role models to other young women who are watching. New York Times had a comment about the show saying it is a “documentary-style series about real-life Junos who are not scoring in the 99th percentile on the verbal portion of their SAT’s”.  It is obvious from such a comment that these girls being aired are not intelligent, nor do they care about their schooling. Regardless of their misplaced priorities, the series attained tremendous amounts of viewers. The result? MTV followed the money trail of teen pregnancy, the very trail they created, and introduced a new series: Teen Mom. Teen mom’s first debut was on December 8th, 2009 and had over 2.1 million viewers. This series took four of the most popular girls on the previous seasons of Sixteen and Pregnant and continued filming their lives with their newborn children.  The girls were Maci Bookout, Farrah Abraham, Catlyn Lowels, and Amber Portwood, each coming with their own set of life issues. Each episode focused on each of the mother’s relationship with their family, friends, boys, and raising a new life. With the new addition of the mother, the drama increased, and synonymously ratings went up and by the end of the first season the show ended with a max of 3.6 million viewers. This was the highest rating MTV has ever gotten on a series. Both shows continued and new sets of teen moms were added to the series making Teen Mom 2, and Teen mom 3. Sixteen and pregnant continues as well and keeps adding new handfuls of pregnant teens on the show. By the end of the fourth and final season on June 12th, 2011 the show had over 5.6 million viewers. The show doesn’t just show the American struggles of a young teen trying to raise a child, but also exemplifies crude behavior. Each episode is packed with verbal and physical abuse. Swear words like “bitch” are audible unlike some of the stronger language used that is censored. Other topics such as marriage, divorce, adoption, birth control, and drugs are also demonstrated through these teens. Common Sense Media states that it is “not age appropriate for kids”, which happens to be most of the shows viewers.  It has been four years since the shows first aired--a disturbing timeline suggesting that the idea of teen pregnancy is gaining popularity among America’s youth. This whirlwind of false glorification, from which teen pregnancy has gained its popularity, needs to be calmed. </p>
