			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>MTV’s hit series Teen Mom and Sixteen and Pregnant influence young teenagers into thinking that they are capable of raising a child.  Having a reality TV show like this on air would be ok if it was a compelling an example on why one shouldn’t get pregnant. In contrast to wholesome morals, the hit series has had countless seasons, meaning more and more teens are getting pregnant. The issue--still unseen by America’s youthful women--is that these teen mothers are now thinking getting pregnant and starring on TV will make them famous. Although the world will know about the young mother, it will be not for good parenting, not for the bond between mother and son or daughter, but for the glamorous fame of being young and pregnant. This problem affects me because I am a young woman and in no way ready to raise children. In my opinion, to be a teenager is to be like a child, how can one expect a child to raise another child? It’s simply not fair to the life brought into this world by irresponsible behavior. Rather than glorifying teens on MTV about having a child, MTV should have some other series on how to prevent pregnancy.  In addition to this issue, the sexually active teen of today needs to be fully informed on the preventions before having intercourse. If one is not taking precautions while having sex, one is not mature enough yet to have sex at all. </p>
