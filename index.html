			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Jenna O’Berski and I am a freshman at Michigan State University.  I am from a small town called Haslett and it’s only a short 5-minute card ride away. My family is everything to me; I have a mom and a dad who are very much in love (they were high school sweet-hearts) and an older brother who is a senior at State. I focus on keeping positive energy around me, doing things to keep myself happy and healthy. I enjoy being outside and keeping active whether that’s with lacrosse or running. My favorite place in the whole world is up north Michigan and all the great things it has to offer. Lots of my friends and I have cottages and I spend most of my summers up there. I absolutely love cats and I have three; Nala, Boo, and Bear. That’s the best part about living so close to home so if I ever feel the need to pet a cat, they are just a short drive away.</p>

			<p>  I am studying marketing and just from my first semester here at state it has shown me that it is in fact my passion. This WRA class helped me learn a lot about myself, which is very rewarding. The project that helped me realize how much I love my major is the formal research project. Through lots of time reading and writing about different kinds and strategies of marketing I learned that this is exactly what I want to do with my life. I also got to meet with an MBA professor and create a relationship with him, he also told me that, “I just look and talk like a marketer”. That made me very happy and excited to keep learning and perusing my dreams. This class helps you not only with college styled writing, but learning how to code websites, and take some one on one time with yourself and your future.</p>
