			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>MTV’s hit series Teen Mom and Sixteen and Pregnant are influencing young teenagers into thinking that they are capable of raising a child. Girls who get pregnant as a teenager have to throw away their life goals because they grew up too fast. But in actuality, their behavior was not grown up behavior at all, and was more childish than anything. Having a child while you are a still a child does not demonstrate mature behavior. That last season of the Teen Mom had over 5.6 million viewers. If that many viewers were watching MTV at that time then that means that many viewers would be tuned into the new show. MTV should want to help the rest of America to make it a better place for kids to grow up. The word “kids” is very appropriate here because they are kids. They do not show signs of being responsible adults in any way.  Teen pregnancy needs to stop and this reality TV show needs to stop too. There needs to be a show that tells young ladies how amazing they are because girls struggle with that. They need examples on how to live healthy--a life style with their friends, families, boyfriends, co-workers, and peers. Having someone to look up to on television would make the viewers more motivated to become successful and independent.  Sixteen and Pregnant and Teen Mom are not improving America’s society; it is destroying it, pulverizing the moral values until the innocence of youth is gone. America needs to focus on taking care of the children and teenagers by formally educating them on safe sex now, before it is too late, and the idea of having kids at a later age is completely gone. </p>
