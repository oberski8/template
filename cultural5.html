			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Now, with stereotypes and negative messages considered, what can one do about these issues? A proposed solution for the issues is to take the show off and replace it with a new hit series. The new show should have strong young women accomplishing things in a positive and productive way. This new idea of a show can film the lives of women who are succeeding, focusing on achievement and positivity rather than past mistakes. Some achievements may be what they are good at, like sports, music, art, school, or work. It should show girls that have a positive attitude, those that are “go-getters”, and those that believe the sky is the limit, and send the message that all they need to do is believe in themselves and work hard. Young women are very confused and insecure about themselves in their teen years. If there were a show to watch how to overcome the battles of personal defeat, then more and more girls would start being more positive. This show needs to include how drugs, alcohol and unprotected sex can destroy not only your future goals, but also your physical body. Everything you dream about, your aspirations, your biggest wants in life, they can all be taken away. With the dangers assessed, the show could then assess that feeling beautiful on the inside helps if you feel beautiful on the outside, and most girls are too insecure to see hoe beautiful they really are. The young women on this new show need to be people that they can relate to and feel close to. Seeing a big sister type of girl or a best friend would be ideal, someone to look up to and follow after is helpful for so many people and the girls on Sixteen and Pregnant are not what most parents want for their daughters. Most of the reality TV shows on MTV are about partying, sex, drugs, fighting, and bad language. That behavior will not help someone succeed in the real world. It will also teach the viewers that this behavior is socially unaccepted and that they cannot act out just as the kids on TV are. </p>
