			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>If these changes were made to MTV then the statistics of teen pregnancy would go down. Also if the new show ideas were added to the channel then more young teenagers would be motivated to be successful adults. If you take show like biggest loser for example, and see what message they are trying to get across America. There is a struggling obese individual that wants to improve their eating and exercise to better their health. After viewers watch shows like that, it motivates them to want to improve themselves too. Watching these young pregnancy shows on television can do two things to the human brain. First it can make the viewer feel like they are so much better then the person on TV and they have nothing wrong about themselves since their life isn’t as bad as the girl they are watching on TV. Or, this can make the viewer get use to the behavior on TV and they will start believing this behavior is normal and ok in society. It is not ok, that is why there needs to be a change. Having this new show added will show the world normal and successful teenagers. None of the drugs and sex, it will show how a teen doesn’t need those things to be socially accepted.  After watching this show it will influence young women to be the best they can be and work hard for. </p>
