		<h1>lived experiences "My Small Little iPhone"</h1>
		<p>	The major I have chosen is marketing. Marketing is the process a business uses to sell and promote the volubility of a product or service, to consumers at large.  I find marketing interesting because you can find something you are passionate about, like a brand, and sell that product to the world. I am Romanian; passion runs through my blood naturally—so this major is perfect for me. I didn’t know what I wanted to do until I got my first real job in a grocery store; I worked for Gordon Food Service. Although I am not passionate about working for a food company, some day I hope to be passionate about a similar type of company. The company runs like a family; family is also really important to me, so it was a great opportunity to be apart of, and see how they run their corporation.  Once I got the hang of things I realized I was really good at marketing their business. While I was working I would try and put as many items into the customers carts as I could with the sales pitches I created. It didn’t stop there— even when I wasn’t working at the store, as soon as people needed ideas of food, for an event or party, I jumped in right away and told them all the amazing things Gordon’s Food Service had to offer.  So that’s when I knew I belonged in the business field, but I still didn’t know what major I would fit into yet.  </p><p>	My whole life I created products or services for people and tried to spread them around.  For instance, in 4th grade I knitted little yarn bracelets that quickly grew in popularity around my peers. As success grew, I decided to put a sign-up sheet on my desk and then filled my orders when I got home. I bet you could guess that I was also one of those kids that had the pointless lemonade stands that no one really wanted to buy from, but I was eager to act cute enough so that the customers would come rolling in and throw quarters in my box. The lemonade was probably watered down and the size of the cup was probably too small, but I did my best trying to reel in the customers. Once I got older, in my teen years, I experimented with makeup, hair, and nail polish and discovered that I was extremely good at all forms of the cosmetic business.  Every time my friends came over they begged me to do their makeup or paint their nails. Regardless, they didn’t have to beg much because I loved to do it; I wanted other people to know that I was talented in these activities because, naturally, I saw this talent as a business opportunity.  This was the moment where I found out that there was a world of possibilities on my small little iPhone</p><p>	I didn’t get a “cool” phone until the middle of high school because my parents were smart and didn’t want me to be exposed to the cruel world of social media—until I was mature enough to handle it. By “cool phone” I mean a phone with Internet and apps like an iPhone. One of the first apps I got was called Instagram. Instagram is an app where you can express yourself through photography. I originally would post pictures of nature or my pets, but eventually posted pictures of the nail designs I created—with that, the feedback was tremendous. I received so much love for my talent by posting my nail design pictures and continuously had girls asking me to paint their nails for all sorts of occasions. Before I knew it I had a little business on my hands and my way of marketing was posting pictures of different designs for my audience of followers to see. Once I started to realize the power of social media was ruling the world I became really involved in my hobbies and developed more things to market myself for. </p><p>	Another thing I am extremely passionate about is music. I love to sing; I’ve been singing my whole life. My voice teacher and I worked on some songs I wanted to record in a legit recording studio. When she told me that, my eyes widen because that’s what pop stars do—not average seventeen-year-old Jenna O'Berski.  Regardless of my celebrity status, we practiced hard. I went to the studio with one of my friends, Zack, and together we recorded some songs for a cd. We were so excited about the finished product that my friend posted the song to Twitter and sent it to country artists because it was a country song. Nothing really happened other than a lot of people listening to it and saying they loved it. Our luck changed and one day an amazing thing happened. A famous country singer, Toby Keith, responded to the song we posted on his page and told us that we were talented kids and that he was impressed. A celebrity heard me sing, and said he liked it. I was in shock. This caused even more people to listen to our song and more famous people and websites to reach out to us. This all happened because of one link we posted to Twitter.</p><p>	I didn’t have a twitter at the time so I personally didn’t know the power this social media had. I recently got one and explored. Basically what I discovered was that everything has a Twitter. By everything I mean everything: teens, businesses, TV shows, universities, clubs, celebrities, pets, clothes, brands—you name and it is on Twitter. You, as the user, get to choose who and what you follow and what you want to see every time you open the app. I started to follow some brands I’m obsessed with and saw when they had sales and promotions and thought to myself, “if I didn’t have this Twitter I would have had no clue about this amazing sale I would of missed”. This is when I for sure knew I wanted to go into marketing. I then realized the direction marketing is going into and how I have kind of been doing it my whole life with my hobbies and talents. If I could do find success in my at-home businesses I could for sure do it for a brand or company someday. </p><p>	Now the question I face is where do I see myself as a successful businesswoman someday? One of the brands I follow on Twitter is Lilly Pulitzer. It’s a clothing store that is super preppy, girly, and has exciting patterns to wear. I absolutely love this brand and by following them on Twitter I get to see how their company works. It seems as if their company runs a lot like Gordon Food service: like a family. They post pictures of the women working in the office and the events they are apart of—and everyone seems so happy (and stylish).  Now the Romanian in me is passionate about this brand and all I want to do is find a way to become apart of the Lilly Pulitzer family. I want to show them what I am capable of and how I can help them grow as a company with my passion and loyalty I will display to the public through my marketing skills and social media. Hopefully someday when I have this job, another teenager just like me will be scrolling on Twitter—or whatever the new thing to do is—and see the advertisement I created about the next sale or new sweater the line just came out with. A girl can dream right?</p><p>	I am thankful I am a part of a generation where technology can make anything possible. I am also thankful that I am apart of such an amazing University that will help me follow the path I need to take to accomplish my dreams of being a successful marketer someday.</p>
