		<h1>lived experiences "My Small Little iPhone"</h1>
		<p>	The major I have chosen is marketing. Marketing is the process a business uses to sell and promote the volubility of a product or service to consumers at large.  I find marketing interesting because you can find something you are passionate about, like a brand, and sell that product to the world. I am Romanian; passion runs through my blood. So naturally, this major is perfect for me. Until I got my first job at a grocery store, I had no clue what I wanted to do. I worked for Gordon Food Service, and though I am not passionate about working for a food company, I was passionate for the company its self. The company runs like a family, family is also really important to me so it was a great opportunity to be apart of. Seeing how they ran the corporation inspired me and made me want to get more involved. Once I got the hang of things, I realized I was really good at marketing their business. While I was working, I would try and put as many items into the customer’s carts as I could with the sales pitches I created. Even off the clock I marketed Gordon’s Food Service and all they had to offer. When people needed ideas of food for an event or party, I jumped in right away telling them what Gordon’s had to offer. Working at Gordon’s was when my passion for marketing and business all started, but I still didn’t know what major I would fit into yet.    </p><p>	My whole life I created products and services for people and tried to spread them around. In 4th grade, I knitted little yarn bracelets and people really liked them so I put a sign up sheet on my desk and would fill my orders when I got home. I bet you could guess that I also was one of those kids that had the pointless lemonade stands that no one really wanted to buy, but if you were cute enough the customers would come rolling in and throwing quarters in my box. The lemonade was probably watered down, and the size of the cup was probably too small, but I did my best trying to reel in the customers. Once I got older and started to I experiment with makeup, hair, and nail polish, I discovered that I was extremely good at all those things.  Every time my friends came over they begged me to do their makeup or paint their nails. But because I loved doing it, the begging wasn’t necessary. I wanted other people to know that I was talented in these activities because naturally I saw this talent as a business opportunity.  This is the moment when I found out there was a world of possibilities on my small little iPhone</p><p>	It wasn’t until half way through high school that I was allowed a phone with Internet. My parents were strict and didn’t want me to be exposed to the cruel world of social media until I was mature enough to handle it. Having the Internet allowed me to become involved in social media through apps on the iPhone. One of the first apps I got was called Instagram. Instagram is an app where you can express yourself through photography. I originally would post pictures of nature or my pets, but everything changed with I posted a picture of one of my nail designs. The feedback was tremendous, I got so much love for my talent by posting pictures of it. I had girls asking me to paint their nails for all sorts of occasions. Before I knew it, I had my own little business on my hands. My way of marketing nails was posting pictures of different designs for my audience of followers to see. Once I started to realize that the power of social media was ruling the world, I got really involved in my hobbies and came up with more things I could market myself for.  </p><p>	Another thing I am extremely passionate about is music. I love to sing, I’ve been singing my whole life. My voice teacher and I worked on some songs I wanted to record in a legit recording studio. When she told me that, my eyes widened because that’s what pop stars do, not me, average seventeen-year-old Jenna O'Berski.  Regardless my celebrity status, I practiced hard. When I went to the studio with one of my friends Zack, together we recorded a country song.  We were so excited about the finished product that my friend posted the song to Twitter and sent it to a great amount of country artists. Nothing really happened other then just a lot of people listening to it and saying they loved it. But one day, an amazing thing happened. A famous country singer, Toby Keith, responded to the song we recorded posted on his page. He told us that we were talented kids and that he was impressed. A celebrity heard me sing, and said he liked it. I was in shock. This caused more people to listen to our song, and more websites to reach out to us. AllI didn’t have a Twitter at the time, so I personally didn’t know the power this social media site had. Basically what I discovered after recently joining was that almost everything has a Twitter. By everything, I mean absolutely everything. Teens, businesses, TV shows, universities, clubs, celebrities, pets, clothes, brands, you name it its on Twitter. You as the user get to choose who and what you follow, and what you want to see every time you open the app. I started to follow some brands I’m obsessed with which allowed me to see when they had sales and promotions. This made me think to myself, if I didn’t have this Twitter, I would have had no clue about these amazing sales. This is when I for sure knew that I wanted to go into marketing. I then realized the direction marketing is going into, and how I have been doing it my whole life through my hobbies and talents. If I could do it with my at home businesses, I could for sure do it for a brand or company someday.  </p><p>	Now the question I face is where do I see myself as a successful businesswoman in the future? One of my favorite brands I follow on Twitter is Lilly Pulitzer. It’s a preppy clothing store that sells girlie clothing, accessories, bedding, and has nationwide famous patterns. I absolutely love this brand and by following them on Twitter I get to see how their company works. It seems as if their company runs a lot like Gordon Food Service, like a family. They post pictures of the women working in the office and the events they are apart of. When they market this, everyone seems so happy (and stylish), I would love to be apart of that.  Now that the Romanian in me is passionate about this brand, all I want to do is find a way to become apart of the Lilly Pulitzer family. I want to show them what I am capable of and how I can help them grow as a company with my passion and loyalty. To accomplish this, I will display to the public my marketing and social media skills. Hopefully someday when I have this job, another teenager just like me will be scrolling Twitter, or whatever the new thing to do is, and see the advertisement I create about the next sale or new sweater the line just came out with. A girl can dream right?</p><p>	I am thankful I am apart of a generation where technology can make anything possible. I am also thankful that I am apart of such an amazing University that will help me follow the path I need to take to accomplish my dreams of being a successful marketer someday.</p>
