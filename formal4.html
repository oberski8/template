			<h1>Different Fields of Marketing</h1>
			<p>There are many different types of marketing a student can study. Marketing is so broad and flexible that it can fit into many different types of business. One of them is market research. Here, an employee can, “investigate why purchasing decisions are made and what kinds of products industrial consumers want to buy” (Roberts).  This is crucial for a company because it provides a wealth of information. It describes a prospective of the customers, the danger of the competition, and general information about the company as a whole.  Marketing researchers are becoming more and more popular because of all the new software that is coming out. It makes the researching process more efficient and easier then ever before. The data they collect gives the business owners the information to help them decide what their next move is in their respective businesses. </p><p>Another type of marketing is public relations, also known as PR. Public relations is a process where a marketer uses the news or press to send out a positive, long-lasting impression on their business or product. These type of employees need to work well with people. PR and marketing are different careers, but just recently they have come together to form Marketing Public Relations, or MPR.  MPR is the word of mouth for a company or in other words marketing and MPR are, “customer-oriented and need two-way communications” which determines what the customer wants and how the company is striving to get it for them (Gideon).  It has been asked why these two fields of business haven’t become one sooner. But now it has been discovered that MPR “can become an important segment of the marketing plan” (Gideon).  Creating that relationship with the consumer is vital for businesses. </p><p> Next is a field in marketing called product development. Humans constantly are looking for change; they never seem to be please they want new, fresh, hot ideas. Especially in this era of time, the generation of millennia’s is persistently trying to be new and different.  This type of marketing is exactly what marketers like to do because they are the creative side of business. A company will change their product when customers are loosing interest or the competitors are having better sales.  Marketers usually are observing the business’s cliental investigating when changes need to be made.  This type of marketing requires lots of research and the use of  “different data sources and sampling of various groups of managers” in order to determine if its time to make a change in the business (Veryzer). This type of career also involves a brain full of ideas and a thirst for coming up with the next best thing. Product development is very exciting and interests marketers that have a keen eye for design and new ideas. </p><p>Lastly, the most popular type of marketing is retail and sales marketing. This is the kind of marketing that usually involves stores and different brands. Jenna Jonjua, a current student in the Eli Broad College of Business had the chance to intern for Moosejaw Mountaineering as a web content coordinator in the marketing department last summer.   Retail marketing is the multiple steps geared toward selling directly to the customer. It “aims marketing efforts straight to the end user customer” Jonjua states. “It’s the final sale, the final step in the marketing process.”  It’s all about the sales in this field, the more sales a business has, the more successful they become, easy as that.  These types of marketers need to have a certain type of personality as well. They need to act as persuaders in order to make the customer think they need those products or service that are trying to be sold.  Retail marketers also need to make the customer take interest in them because retail is “a sector of business that is run by the consumer” and if the customers aren’t satisfied they are going to move on to the next store or service. (Jonjua).  Retail marketers have a passion for selling and improving their skills daily.  </p>
