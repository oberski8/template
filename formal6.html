			<h1>Communication</h1>
			<p>Communication is the most important part of marketing. Marketing is communication, it’s “interacting with people verbally, or literally” (Wilson).  The image that is set out to the public is how the company presents themselves. That’s the job of the marketer, to create that said “image” of the business.  These types of marketers are usually specialized in advertisement and branding. Advertisements are what the public eye will see about one’s store or service. Advertisements are everywhere: sporting events, billboards, TV, magazines, social media, signs, etc. This is a sure fire way for people to see what companies are all about. As for marketers who are involved in branding a company, need to be a hundred percent passionate in what they are selling. This job is for someone who is good with people and who will eat, sleep, and breath the brand. Wearing that product everyday and telling anyone about it is the type of passion they will need. Another personality trait needed to be a marketer is persuasion. A persuasive person is one who can urge someone else to believe that something is appealing with reason and understanding. This is done by communicating with people and gaining their trust. Marketers are “always connecting with consumers and suppliers” presenting them with something they can agree with (Wilson).  Marketers are essentially the voice of the company and it is crucial to get important messages out for the world to see. </p>
