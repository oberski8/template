			<p>9-12-13</p> <p> The Purpose of The Video</p> <ul><li>The purpose of the video was a way for the author to cope with his emotions. The author shared similarities with his uncle Ronnie of once being married and then divorcing his wife because he discovered he was gay. This letter he wrote to his dead uncle was a way to vent about how he feels lost in this world and he wished uncle Ronnie was still here to talk to. Iâ€™m glad he took his actions of depression in literature and not in suicide like uncle Ronnie.</li>
