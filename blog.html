			<p>9-12-13</p> <p> The Purpose of The Video</p> <ul><li>The purpose of the video was a way for the author to cope with his emotions. The author shared similarities with his uncle Ronnie of once being married and then divorcing his wife because he discovered he was gay. This letter he wrote to his dead uncle was a way to vent about how he feels lost in this world and he wished uncle Ronnie was still here to talk to. I’m glad he took his actions of depression in literature and not in suicide like uncle Ronnie.</li></ul><p>How the Video Attempts Achieve its Purpose</p><ul><li>The video achieves its purpose because through the emotion the author gave while reading his letter, it let the audience feel his pain.  Not only was his writing powerful, but also the way he delivered the message with his voice and true emotions gave me a taste of what he is feeling. </li></ul><p>The Structure of the Message </p><ul><li>The structure of the message was a personal letter that the author wrote to his dead uncle. He did this as a way of venting his feelings out in a healthy action. The author probably wanted to make it into a video so people across the nation that share the same story can relate to him.</li></ul><p>How This Video's Structure Can Help You Revise Your Lived Experiences Project</p><ul><li>This video helped me realize that I need to add more emotion and passion into my narrative. The way I wrote my paper was fact after fact because that’s the only way my high schoolteacher would let us write. I feel so free now with this writing assignment and I cant wait to make changes and actually have fun when I write. </li></ul>


<p>9-19-13</p><p>My Lived Experience Project</p> <p><ul><li>While writing my first college paper I came across a great amount of difficulties. First off I couldn’t seem to get the hang of the whole “narrative” thing because when I took AP English in high school my boring teacher brainwashed me into writing like a zombie. Everything had to be in MLA and it was horrible. Now, I have freedom to write something about my self and something I am passionate about and I didn’t even know how to. Once I finally realized that I could have fun while writing and redid the whole thing and couldn’t stop writing. Before I was dreading trying to figure out 1200 words to fill my assignment but when I had freedom I couldn’t stop. It was finally fun to write again and its all thanks to my lived experience project in WRA 110.  I know my next assignment isn’t about myself or a narrative but its still about an interesting topic rather then reading Shakespeare and trying to find motifs that relate to a skull in a graveyard. That’s not me, that’s not anyone my age. We are young and wild and free, and yes I did just say that but its true and I’m glad my professor knows that and is making writing fun again. I can’t wait to see what is left in this semester.</p></li></ul>
<p>10-3-18</p><p>"The Social Network" The Correlation between Formal Education and Economic and Personal Success</p><p><ul><li>In this movie the main character Mark Zkerberg was born a genius. He attended Harvard so us as viewers already knew he was a smart person. As the film went on we could see how he naturally knew how to do everything on his computer and he could whip up something incredible within seconds. Another example was in the scene where he was sitting in class and he got up to leave but the teacher called him out for it and told him “even the smartest kids failed his class”. When he got up he answered the professors question correctly and left the room. So naturally Mark is a very intelligent fellow. He ended up becoming a billionaire not from what he learned in school but because he was a mad genius. He did what he needed to do to be successful even if it meant backstabbing friends along the way. I personally think going to college for a formal education is extremely important because not everyone is going to be as successful as Mark Zkerberg. I do know quite a few people in my life time that did not attend college and our living quite comfortably, probably a lot more comfortable then I will live someday and I plan on getting my education. In this case I call it luck. Someone had a good idea, they did what they needed to do and they are mad geniuses. I’m not a mad genius, I’m just Jenna O’Berski and I am going to need to complete school with hard work and hopefully someday complete and fulfill what I want to succeed in life. In the end I believe that a formal education is necessary but as Mark Zkerberg has displayed it is not necessary for everyone. </p></li></ul><p>10-10-13</p><p>Cultural Analysis Project</p><p><ul><li>This project was very enjoyable to me. Instead of reading a boring book and writing a paper about it *cough, cough, AP English* I got to investigate something that I probably watched or listened to everyday and discuss what’s so wrong about it. It really made me start to think about how wrong our society is becoming. Everything on TV or the radio is very inappropriate. I wrote my paper on Teen Mom the MTV series and it was interesting to research what the public also thought about it. Teen pregnancy is nothing to joke about because that can ultimately ruin someone’s dreams and goals for the future. Teenagers need to be more responsible and start using their heads instead of thinking in the moment. Start thinking of the big picture and that little life that you are bringing into this world. It’s not time yet so just wait. Overall I enjoyed taking something that I never really thought of that deeply, and investigating it for something deeper. </p></li></ul><p>10-24-13</p><p>A Preview Of My Formal Research Project</p><p><ul><li>When this project was presented in class the first thing I saw was “research paper” and “2700-3000 words” I immediately groaned and complained like any normal teenager. I thought automatically “well this is going to suck”. That is a typical college student for you right there. But once I started researching and understanding what I was about to write, I started enjoying myself. My paper is on marketing which is my chosen major. I personally don’t get to learn anything about marketing until I get into the business school my junior year. If I do good my first two years I get rewarded with actual classes that mean something to me. Well that’s how I look at it; it’s like a privilege in a way because our business school is so prestigious.  Since I am only a freshman I don’t really know too much about marketing. Reading articles and searching things on the web and talking to people that have worked in this field really opened my eyes. There is so much you can do with this major. The possibilities are endless and it seems perfect for me. I just started writing this thing so I will blog about how I feel with the finished product. Wish me luck!</p></li></ul><p>11-4-13</p><p>Finishing My Research Paper</p><p><ul><li>Like I said for my other blog post about this paper I was initially dreading it.  I thought, “3000 words that’s crazy?!”. But then as I researched my major I learned more then I thought I would. There is so much I can do with marketing.  I can physically work on site and interact with customers. I can do research or online work. I can make lots of blog post or social media post and all of these options sound great.  Another thing I learned while researching is that I know for a fact this major is perfect for me. You need to be a creator and a persuader, and when I took a business personality test I got both of those. I was also dreading the interview with the professor I never met before. I walked into Dales office (head of marketing at MSU) and he greeted me with a smile. He was so nice and after a while of talking he stopped me and said, “you just seem like you are going to be a great marketer Jenna”. This made me very happy because that is what I am so passionate about. Overall I ended up loving this project, I thought it was great and I learned so much and met great people from it.</li></ul></p><p>11-7-13</p><p>Eminem Commercial </p><p><ul><li>The advertisement of the Chrysler 300 was outstanding. The producers did a very good job of capturing the ruggedness and pride Detroit holds with in.  The imagery of Detroit was very important because it gave shots of the city that showed the audience its hard work the citizens do to keep it the city that it is. The imagery is tied in very well with the voice over of the man. HE sounded like he belonged to the community and that he had a personal relationship to Detroit. The song “loose yourself” by Eminem was also perfect because Eminem is from Detroit and one of our Icons of the city. To have him in the commercial representing Detroit is outstanding. The whole point of this commercial and saying “imported from Detroit” is important because yes its not an Italian sports car, and yes Detroit isn’t the greatest city out there, but it has history and passion and our American cars, and they cam from Detroit Michigan. All of these tools of advertisement did a great job showing the power that Detroit has and how our cars that come from here, and like nothing else. </li></ul></p><p>11-17-13</p><p>Working On Our Documentary </p><p><ul><li>Our next project is focusing on one of our group member’s paper. We chose Mitch’s paper on how he tore his ACL. We are taking his story and forming it into an informative and emotional documentary. Mitch tore his ACL in high school playing football. He said his life changed after that. He had to go through surgery and recover and you can imagine an athlete not being able to run or even walk was upsetting. So that is our story that we are going to film. Today we went to Biggby as a group and discussed what exactly we will film. We wrote down a script and made deadlines for ourselves so we can get this thing done.I think the hardest part of the project wil be editing the video. Niether of us are sure on how to use video editing softwares but we will learn together and try our best. I hope our image of how we see the video in our head comes out the same if not better in our actual documentary. I think our video will be very well done and bring a great message on how tearing your ACL affects your life afterwards. Wish us luck!</p></ul></li><p>11-18-13</p><p>My Experience With My First Hybrid Class</p><p><ul><li>When I heard this WRA class was a hybrid class, I didn’t exactly know what that meant. Someone eventually told me that it was a class that you would visit once a week and the rest was online. I originally though oh we find out what we have to write about and then write it and submit it online. Yes that is what we do, but that’s not the “online” part.  The hybrid part of the class is designing our very own websites where our papers can be viewed. I was so excited to learn how to do this but I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Don’t get me wrong I still like it and think its cool but it is a lot of hard work. We had to learn all these codes and formulas to plug in for the simplest stuff. Like to make one bullet point I have to so this < p > start a new paragraph, < ul > show that I am creating a list, < li > then the li means it is unordered meaning not numbered but bullet point. Its very confusing and frustrating but I am very thankful I am learning how to do it.</p></ul></li><p>10-10-13</p><p>Website Madness</p><p><ul><li>Putting my essay in the template for my Cultural Analysis project was madness!!! It was so tedious. I wish there were a simpler way of putting my papers on my website with out all the copying of files and changing little numbers and names in each one to make them work. BUT since that is not an option right now I am going to get over it and do it. For this project we had to make different “tabs” so that each paragraph was in its own section. By doing this you could click the next tab to read the next paragraph and this made the essay not as boring to read because it wasn’t a big long page of words, it was divided up and looked nicer to read.  Its so interesting how much you have to create for the little things on a website. It makes me start wondering how other businesses or big websites like twitter and Facebook were created. Also how are others allowed to share there own stuff and that website. We are nowhere near that advance with our website making but I did learn how to make tabs for my pages and that looks great so far.</p></ul></li>
