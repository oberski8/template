			<p>9-12-13</p> <p> The Purpose of The Video</p> <ul><li>The purpose of the video was a way for the author to cope with his emotions. The author shared similarities with his uncle Ronnie of once being married and then divorcing his wife because he discovered he was gay. This letter he wrote to his dead uncle was a way to vent about how he feels lost in this world and he wished uncle Ronnie was still here to talk to. I’m glad he took his actions of depression in literature and not in suicide like uncle Ronnie.</li></ul><p>How the Video Attempts Achieve its Purpose</p><ul><li>The video achieves its purpose because through the emotion the author gave while reading his letter, it let the audience feel his pain.  Not only was his writing powerful, but also the way he delivered the message with his voice and true emotions gave me a taste of what he is feeling. </li></ul><p>The Structure of the Message </p><ul><li>The structure of the message was a personal letter that the author wrote to his dead uncle. He did this as a way of venting his feelings out in a healthy action. The author probably wanted to make it into a video so people across the nation that share the same story can relate to him.</li></ul><p>How This Video's Structure Can Help You Revise Your Lived Experiences Project</p><ul><li>This video helped me realize that I need to add more emotion and passion into my narrative. The way I wrote my paper was fact after fact because that’s the only way my high schoolteacher would let us write. I feel so free now with this writing assignment and I cant wait to make changes and actually have fun when I write. </li></ul>


<p>9-19-13</p><p>My Lived Experience Project</p> <p><ul><li>While writing my first college paper I came across a great amount of difficulties. First off I couldn’t seem to get the hang of the whole “narrative” thing because when I took AP English in high school my boring teacher brainwashed me into writing like a zombie. Everything had to be in MLA and it was horrible. Now, I have freedom to write something about my self and something I am passionate about and I didn’t even know how to. Once I finally realized that I could have fun while writing and redid the whole thing and couldn’t stop writing. Before I was dreading trying to figure out 1200 words to fill my assignment but when I had freedom I couldn’t stop. It was finally fun to write again and its all thanks to my lived experience project in WRA 110.  I know my next assignment isn’t about myself or a narrative but its still about an interesting topic rather then reading Shakespeare and trying to find motifs that relate to a skull in a graveyard. That’s not me, that’s not anyone my age. We are young and wild and free, and yes I did just say that but its true and I’m glad my professor knows that and is making writing fun again. I can’t wait to see what is left in this semester.</p></li></ul>
<p>10-3-18</p><p>The Correlation between Formal Education and Economic and Personal Success</p><p><ul><li>In this movie the main character Mark Zkerberg was born a genius. He attended Harvard so us as viewers already knew he was a smart person. As the film went on we could see how he naturally knew how to do everything on his computer and he could whip up something incredible within seconds. Another example was in the scene where he was sitting in class and he got up to leave but the teacher called him out for it and told him “even the smartest kids failed his class”. When he got up he answered the professors question correctly and left the room. So naturally Mark is a very intelligent fellow. He ended up becoming a billionaire not from what he learned in school but because he was a mad genius. He did what he needed to do to be successful even if it meant backstabbing friends along the way. I personally think going to college for a formal education is extremely important because not everyone is going to be as successful as Mark Zkerberg. I do know quite a few people in my life time that did not attend college and our living quite comfortably, probably a lot more comfortable then I will live someday and I plan on getting my education. In this case I call it luck. Someone had a good idea, they did what they needed to do and they are mad geniuses. I’m not a mad genius, I’m just Jenna O’Berski and I am going to need to complete school with hard work and hopefully someday complete and fulfill what I want to succeed in life. In the end I believe that a formal education is necessary but as Mark Zkerberg has displayed it is not necessary for everyone. </p></li></ul>
