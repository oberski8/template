			<p>9-12-13</p> <p> The Purpose of The Video</p> <ul><li>The purpose of the video was a way for the author to cope with his emotions. The author shared similarities with his uncle Ronnie of once being married and then divorcing his wife because he discovered he was gay. This letter he wrote to his dead uncle was a way to vent about how he feels lost in this world and he wished uncle Ronnie was still here to talk to. Iâ€™m glad he took his actions of depression in literature and not in suicide like uncle Ronnie.</li></ul><p>How the Video Attempts Achieve its Purpose</p><ul><li>The video achieves its purpose because through the emotion the author gave while reading his letter, it let the audience feel his pain.  Not only was his writing powerful, but also the way he delivered the message with his voice and true emotions gave me a taste of what he is feeling. </li></ul><p>The Structure of the Message </p><ul><li>The structure of the message was a personal letter that the author wrote to his dead uncle. He did this as a way of venting his feelings out in a healthy action. The author probably wanted to make it into a video so people across the nation that share the same story can relate to him.</li></ul>
