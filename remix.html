      <h1>Documentary Memo</h1>
      <p> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI53qTAiTYc&feature=youtu.be">Documentary</p>
       <p>Our documentary is based on Mitchel Tarn’s story of him tearing his ACL. This injury is very common for athletes these days and the most heartbreaking.  We picked this story because a lot of people can relate to knee injuries and we also wanted our audience to realize the frustration that comes with it.  This documentary is simple and Mitch does a great job expressing his personal story to the camera.</p><p>We selected this topic because it is a rising issue in young athletes daily lives. This injury is so common now that every sports team is doing what they can to keep their athletes’ knees strong and safe. This project was not challenging for Mitch at all. In fact, he loves to share his story with anyone who wants to listen because the things he learned from it are very rewarding.  But from an editor’s point of view, this was a challenging project because of the vast amount of detail and information Mitch told the camera that we simply could not keep because the video requirements are 7-9 minutes long.  Our approach of the video was just let Mitch record himself alone, telling his story. We gave him no requirements, just asked him to say what he felt. After that we wrote out a plan on how we wanted our video to look and how we wanted Mitch’s story presented to the public.</p><p>The research I put into this project was all from YouTube. First, I searched how to edit on iMovie. This was a new tool for me to use but I quickly learned how it works and it ended up being very easy to create a documentary on. Secondly, we wanted to educate our audience on how an ACL tear is repaired. So do to this, we researched for different doctors explaining the procedure. I personally learned a lot from listening to the doctors but it turns out that Mitch already knew all this and did a great job of explaining it on his own. Unfortunately, we had to cut his explanation out for timing purposes. </p><p>Our group was a very good team. We got together twice before we started filming. We first discussed what our topic would be and what would be most interesting for our audiences. That’s when we chose to use Mitchel Tarn’s story. He enjoys telling his story so this was exciting for him. We discussed the outline of the video and what we wanted the feel of the documentary to be.  Working in a group was helpful because first, we got to make new friends. Secondly, we got to work together to make a project using tools that may have been new to us. I enjoyed the group project because the pressure wasn’t all on me and I’ve realized that sometimes three heads are better then one. </p><p>Planning went very well when it came to the project but all of our plans did not fall through. For example, we wanted the actual doctor from Mitch’s surgery to let us interview him and ask him questions about the procedure. After calling many times, we left messages but still got no return. To substitute for that idea we wanted to find doctors online that specialized in knee injuries and take it from the web to put in our video. We searched and searched and none of them would fit into our movie so we decided to keep it personal and just have Mitch telling the story. Also, we really wanted to put the video of Mitch actually tearing his ACL in the game to give a visual but the video would not input into the computer for us to copy. If I could of done this differently I would of wanted more time. I really wanted to have to doctor share his knowledge with us too. One last thing I wish I could of done differently is spend more time learning how to use iMovie to make the documentary look a little more legit. </p><p>Our documentary is most effective in the aspect that it’s enlightening people who have not experienced this pain. Tearing your ACL is very frustrating for active people. It forces your body to stay put when all you want to do is move. Mitch describes his feelings after this journey and how his perspective on life has changed in a positive way. We kept our video very simple because it’s not the video format itself that’s important, it’s the message that we are trying to get across. We all knew we wanted this to be a pretty basic design because if not then people wouldn’t take us seriously. Overall, our documentary is clean, informative, personal, and rewarding which is what we aimed to portray.</p>
