			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>When MTV started advertising for Sixteen and Pregnant ratings went through the roof. Everyone was curious about what kind of content would be on the show. Once commercials got out on television the audience had a good glimpse of what this show was all about. It had four young high school girls far along in their pregnancy. The previews also showed the types of life styles they live and they are nothing to be bragging about. There was lots of swearing, abuse, dysfunctional relationships, and drug use. Even though the show wasnâ€™t appropriate the amount of viewers every week began to grow. So much that a second series was added to it called Teen Mom. This show took the girls they casted on Sixteen and Pregnant and documented their lives with their newborn children and the struggles they go through as young mothers. The way the show filmed their lives did not present the mothers as successful women but rather struggling parents. This is not something that needs to be on TV for young teenage girls to follow. There needs to be a series that will make young girls motivated into becoming responsible adults.</p>
