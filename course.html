      <h1>My Personal Experience With WRA 110</h1>
       <p>It’s everyone’s dream to take a writing class in college. I’m totally kidding, it’s actually the opposite and most students dread the one semester of writing they are required to do. To change this attitude, one can take WRA 110 Science and Technology. I am not a fan of writing and I really enjoyed what I learned throughout this semester. The class is hybrid, meaning we only met once a week and the rest of the class was completed online. The online portion consisted of creating and designing a website. Most of us average MSU students have no idea how to do this, however we were given a very helpful website called Codecademy to help us learn the codes needed to build a webpage. Along with the web creating there were 4 papers, a blog page, documentary, and reading assignments.  Since we only met once a week the main thing for us to remember is to stay organized because the reading and Codecademy were not checked weekly, but are checked at the very end and it’s then important to follow the schedule posted online. That being said, the schedule can be changed because of cancelled class or if students need more time to write our papers. Being responsible and checking the schedule and getting the assignments done on time will make this a successful class for anyone who takes it.</p><p>The first paper we were assigned was the Lived Experience Project.  This project had us think about what kind of technology inspired us to go into the major you have chosen. This project is personal; don’t write about some sort of technology and how it works and how people use it in their job, that’s not what the professor wants. Trust me, because I made that mistake and had to re-write the whole thing. Talk about yourself and what inspires you to be whom you want to be when you grow up. The technology factor may have been something that impacted your life in a positive way. For example, someone who wants to be a doctor may have had an illness and was fascinated about the machines and tools they used to heal you. My major is marketing, so I talked about how the power of social media is changing the world, and that inspired me to become a marketer. Again this is a personal essay, and is a great way to start the semester writing about something that you are passionate about.</p><p>The second project was called the Cultural Analysis Project. This was also an enjoyable project to write because we as a class had a lot of freedom with what we got to choose to write about. We were assigned to take some sort of TV show, movie, music video, song, or video game and discuss how it is portrayed a bad image-what some might call a negative influence. Before you start this project, really think about what you would like to write about. Think about something you may watch or listen to everyday and don’t really think about the message its sending out to the public. I thought about TV shows that I have watched and immediately thought about Teen Mom on MTV. This show had so many horrible things to discuss so it wasn’t that hard of an assignment. Some common arguments you can talk about in your projects include: drugs, violence, how women are treated, teen behavior, and just negative things that are available for the public to watch or enjoy as “entertainment”.  This is a fun assignment because you get to maturely look at media from a different perspective, dissecting the morals and messages that are transferred to the consciousness of the public.</p><p>Our third paper was the most challenging and lengthy paper we had. This assignment was called the formal research project. It focused on your discipline and all the facts you could research to inform someone about your major. Not only did this assignment require writing, but it required research on scholarly articles, interviews from a professor, and someone who has worked in that field you wish to study. My first advice when it comes to this project is contacting your interviewees right away. They may not respond, or can’t meet up soon enough, or simply won’t want to. I struggled finding a professor that would make time for me to come in and ask questions. While waiting for interviewers to respond you should spend time looking up articles about your major and take notes on what you read because you will need to use quotes to back up what you say. This is not a paper you want to blow off to the last minute because it takes a long time to construct something with that much information. Another piece of advice: don’t go into it with a bad attitude. If you choose to disregard that advice, then this paper will not be enjoyable at all. Yes it is very long and not an easy write, but the feeling I got when I finished was very rewarding. Not only do you get to write a very impressive paper, but also you get the chance to network with some important figures here on campus, and really learn more about what you are about to study for the next four plus years. Take it as an opportunity that is beneficial and try to have fun with it. Stay focused, timely, and organized and this paper wont be as bad as it sounds.</p><p>After that long and rigorous research paper you get to have some fun. The next project is a documentary and you are in groups.  Amongst your group you decide on one of your three papers to turn into a documentary. This is called your remix project.  This is an assignment that lets you be a little more creative and maybe even try something you haven’t done before, like filming and editing a movie.  Pick a paper that has a nice story that people would be interested to watch. It will make it more fun for you as a group to create and more enjoyable for the class to watch.  Group projects can sometimes be tricky in college because everyone has different schedules and live in various locations. When assigned a group, get everyone’s contact info and schedule when and where things need to get done so you wont fall behind or end up doing the whole thing yourself. This is a great assignment to try something new and meet new people, have fun with it!</p><p>Besides all the writing you have a ton of online work to do as well. Firstly, two things you want to keep up with the whole semester are blog posts and Codecademy. You are required to have 15-blog posts reflecting what you do in class by the end of the semester. If you don’t keep on track with those you may struggle on what to write about further on. Codecademy is a website that helped us as students to learn how to code html and CSS to create websites for all our work. This website keeps track of all the lessons you take, which are also assigned to you each week on the schedule for you to complete. By the end of the semester you should have completed 160 points of Codecademy, this shows the professor that you did your web learning and you stayed on track. The last thing you do online is add everything to your website. You are given a template to work with from the teacher. This template helps you out on all your essays online, but by the end of the semester you need to have created your own template and design. This part is challenging if you are not acclimated to its use. That being said, make sure you learn what you are doing on Codecademy or ask questions in class.</p><p>If you haven’t noticed I said “at the end of the semester” a bunch.  This can screw you up because if you don’t pay attention to what is assigned every week then you can fall really behind.  The professor does not check to see if you did the homework every week, she waits till the end of the semester. This class only meets once a week so the workload is not too heavy, and it’s not impossible so just do it like the schedule says and you should see no problems. I know that no freshman wants to come into college and take a writing class, but this particular writing class was very beneficial I believe. Not only do you write the way a college professor desires you to, but you also get to discover a whole new world of technology. Website design is not a joke. It’s hard work and takes time and patience to learn. You all can do it.  If you want to enjoy your freshman writing class, I suggest you take WRA 110, science and technology, the hybrid class. Because you will learn things you never thought you were going to learn in a WRA. Go into this with a good attitude and follow this simple advice and you will do just fine.</p>
